	<h2>The Author</h2>
	<p><strong>Short Bio:</strong> 21-year-old with experience in both gi and no-gi BJJ, aiming to spread the wonders of Jiu-Jitsu.</p>
	<p><strong>Long Bio:</strong>This site is created by me, Trevor Mendes. I am a 21 year old living just outside 
		Wilmington, North Carolina where I have been training about Brunson's MMA and 
		Fitness (shoutout Brunson's MMA at Independence Mall), mainly doing their No-Gi
		Jiu-Jitsu practices. I have been training there for just over three months now,
		and before that, trained at United Fighting Arts Institute (UFAI) up in Vermont.
		<br><br>
		I was born and raised in Vermont, and living their for 20 years, I have always
		dreamed about becoming a star-athlete. Specifically, I have always wanted to be
		a UFC fighter. After coming to terms with the fact that professional fighters
		get a lot of brain damage, I resigned to the goal of becoming the best BJJ
		practioner in the world. Currently, that title belongs to Gordon Ryan.</p>
